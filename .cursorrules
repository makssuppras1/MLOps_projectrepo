# CRITICAL: Pre-Flight Checks Before Vertex AI Jobs

**ALWAYS RUN PRE-FLIGHT CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING ANY VERTEX AI JOB:**

```bash
# Run before EVERY job submission
./scripts/preflight_check.sh
```

This script checks:
- Platform architecture (linux/amd64 for Mac)
- Service account permissions
- Image exists in correct region
- Config validation
- Data accessibility
- Quotas

**Common issues that MUST be checked:**
1. Platform mismatch (ARM64 Mac → must build for linux/amd64)
2. Image not in correct region
3. Missing service account permissions
4. Wrong Hydra config path (absolute /configs for Docker)
5. Data not accessible

See `docs/PRE_FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md` for full details.
