Tests cover: root endpoint (GET /), health endpoint (GET /health), valid predict requests (POST /predict), invalid predict requests (missing field, wrong type, empty string). Tests handle both cases where model is loaded and not loaded (503 status). One deprecation warning about @app.on_event - this is expected and doesn't affect functionality."

To run load tests: 1) Start API server (uv run invoke api), 2) Set MYENDPOINT env var, 3) Run locust command, 4) Open http://localhost:8089 in browser. The locustfile includes tasks for GET / (weight 1), GET /health (weight 3), and POST /predict (weight 5) to simulate realistic usage patterns."
