# Training hyperparameters
# AGGRESSIVELY simplified defaults for ultra-fast, minimal-cost training
training:
  seed: 42  # Random seed for reproducibility

  batch_size: 128  # Larger batch for fewer iterations
  epochs: 1  # Single epoch
  max_length: 32  # Very short sequences for fastest processing
  num_workers: 0  # No parallel workers to reduce overhead
  max_samples: 200  # Minimal samples for ultra-fast training
  max_steps: 50  # Hard cap: stop after 50 steps

  optimizer:
    _target_: torch.optim.Adam
    lr: 0.001  # Simple, stable learning rate

  loss_fn:
    _target_: torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss

  log_interval: 10  # Less frequent logging for speed

  # Paths
  model_save_path: "trained_model.pt"  # Default name for reproducibility tester
  figure_save_path: "reports/figures/training_statistics.png"
  figure_size: [12, 4]  # Smaller figure size

  # Profiling
  profile: false  # Set to true to enable profiling
