training:
  seed: 42
  batch_size: 128  # Increased for faster training (fewer iterations)
  epochs: 1  # Single epoch - exactly 1 epoch as required
  max_length: 32  # Very short sequences for fast tokenization and processing
  num_workers: 0  # No parallel workers to reduce overhead
  max_samples: 2000  # Exactly 2,000 papers as required
  max_steps: null  # Remove step limit to allow full epoch
  max_runtime_hours: 0.5  # Strict 30-minute limit
  log_interval: 10  # Less frequent logging
